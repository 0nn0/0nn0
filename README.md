👋 Hi! I work at [Tempo](https://www.yourtempo.co) were we -  a team of 7 spread over Europe - are building the email client that helps you focus. One that shields you from the chaos of incoming email and guides you into more mindful email behavior.

👨‍💻 My work at Tempo centers around product, front-end development and project management.

📣 At Tempo we're looking for a [iOS and/or React-Native developer](https://www.yourtempo.co/positions/react-native-developer) to help us build the mobile app. If this sounds like you or anyone you know then please reach out to me through onno@yourtempo.co.
