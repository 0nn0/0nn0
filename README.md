👋 Hi there! My name is Onno, and I'm a freelance Front-end Developer based in Amsterdam. Since I started working in the _www_ in 2005. Since then, I co-founded SaaS startup [Tempo](https://www.yourtempo.co), co-founded product development studio [Pillar](https://pillarstudio.com), worked at [Sid Lee](http://sidlee.com) and freelanced for many years in between.

🧑‍🎨 I'm a maker at heart and enjoy working on the intersection of design and technology. It's my aim to build products that bring real value to people. A pragmatist that also understands the value of the last 5 percent.

🧰 Over the years, I have used a variety of technologies, from Actionscript, PHP to jQuery. Nowadays, my technology stack often includes ReactJS, NextJS, TailwindCSS, etc. 

💌 Interested in hiring me? Or do you want to collaborate together on a side-project? Happy to chat! Just reach out to me by email.
