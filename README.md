👋 Hi there! My name is Onno, and I'm a freelance Front-end Developer based in Amsterdam. Since I started working in the _www_ in 2005, I co-founded SaaS startup [Tempo](https://www.yourtempo.co), co-founded product development studio [Pillar](https://pillarstudio.com), worked at [Sid Lee](http://sidlee.com) and freelanced for many years in between.

🧑‍🎨 I'm a maker at heart, and someone that truly enjoys working on the intersection of design and technology. I have a strong focus on the product and aim to build products that bring real value to people. A pragmatist that also understands the value of the last 5 percent.

🧰 I've used a wide variety of technologies, from Actionscript in Flash, PHP and myself to jQuery. In my most recent years, my technology stack often included ReactJS, NextJS, StyledJSX, Jest, Storybook, and Electron. However, I'm curious to go a bit outside my bubble and try Svelte and Remix.run and learn more about the back-end.

💌 Interested in hiring me, or looking for someone to collaborate with on a side-project? Happy to chat! Just reach out to me by email or Twitter. Details in the column on the left.
