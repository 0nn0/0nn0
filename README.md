ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I work at [Tempo](https://www.yourtempo.co) were we -  a team of 7 spread over Europe - are building the email client that helps you focus. One that shields you from the chaos of incoming email and guides you into more mindful email behavior.

My work at Tempo centers around product, front-end development and project management.

ðŸ“± At Tempo we're looking for a [iOS and/or React-Native developer](https://www.yourtempo.co/positions/react-native-developer) to help us build the mobile app. If this sounds like you or anyone you know then please reach out to me through onno@yourtempo.co.
